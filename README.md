# Atom L33t UI theme

A dark UI theme for Atom, made to be used with my [L33t colorscheme](https://github.com/Arc0re/l33t-h4ck3rs-atom-theme).

This theme is installed by default with Atom and can be activated by going to
the _Themes_ section in the Settings view (`cmd-,`) and selecting it from the
_UI Themes_ drop-down menu.
